# üîê Secret Verification Guide

## How to Verify Your GEMINI_API_KEY is Set Correctly

### Method 1: Check via GitHub Web UI (Recommended)

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   ```
   https://github.com/kundan007b/bhaskar-daily-ai-news
   ```

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click the "Settings" tab at the top
   
3. **Go to Secrets and Variables:**
   - In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables"
   - Click "Actions"

4. **Verify the secret exists:**
   - You should see `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the list
   - It will show when it was last updated
   - You cannot view the actual value (for security)

### Method 2: Test with a Workflow Run

The best way to verify it works is to trigger a test run:

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/kundan007b/bhaskar-daily-ai-news/actions
   ```

2. **Select the workflow:**
   - Click "Auto Generate & Publish Posts"

3. **Run workflow manually:**
   - Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
   - Select branch: `main`
   - Click the green "Run workflow" button

4. **Watch the execution:**
   - Click on the running workflow
   - Click on the "generate" job
   - Watch the logs in real-time

5. **Check for success:**
   - ‚úÖ If the secret is correct: You'll see successful post generation
   - ‚ùå If the secret is missing/wrong: You'll see an API authentication error

### Method 3: Check Recent Workflow Runs

If workflows have already run:

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/kundan007b/bhaskar-daily-ai-news/actions
   ```

2. **Look at recent runs:**
   - Green checkmark ‚úÖ = Secret is working
   - Red X ‚ùå = Check the logs for errors

3. **Click on a run to see details:**
   - Expand the "Generate post" step
   - Look for error messages about API keys

### Expected Behavior

```

### Security Checks

‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
