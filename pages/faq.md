        How does Bhaskar Daily AI News work?
      </h2>
      <p style="color: #5f6368; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
        Our platform uses advanced AI technology (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI DALL-E 3) to automatically generate news content every hour. The system creates bilingual articles in both English and Hindi, covering Politics, Business, Technology, Finance, and Startups. All content is AI-curated and published automatically through GitHub Actions.
      </p>

    <!-- FAQ 2 -->
    <div class="faq-item" style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 4px solid #34a853;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #202124; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
        Is the content reliable and accurate?
      </h2>
      <p style="color: #5f6368; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
        While we use state-of-the-art AI models to generate content, AI-generated articles should be verified with official sources before making important decisions. We recommend cross-referencing information with traditional news outlets for critical matters. Our content is meant to provide quick, accessible summaries of current events.
      </p>

        How often is content updated?
      </h2>
      <p style="color: #5f6368; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
        New articles are automatically generated and published twice per hour (at :00 and :40 minutes past each hour). This means we publish approximately 120 articles per day across all five categories, ensuring fresh content throughout the day.

      </h2>
      <p style="color: #5f6368; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
        Every article is published in both English and Hindi. You can toggle between languages using the language switcher button on each article page. The Hindi content uses proper Devanagari script and maintains the same quality and depth as the English version.
