## ISRO's Revolutionary AI Guardian System

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced the successful deployment of **AI Guardian**, a groundbreaking artificial intelligence-powered system designed to protect India's critical satellite infrastructure from the growing threat of space debris.

### The Challenge of Space Debris

With over 34,000 pieces of tracked debris orbiting Earth at velocities exceeding 27,000 km/h, space debris has become one of the most significant threats to operational satellites. A single collision can create hundreds of new debris fragments, escalating the problem exponentially.

> "Space debris poses an unprecedented challenge to our satellite missions. AI Guardian represents India's commitment to ensuring the safety and longevity of our space assets," said Dr. Arun Sharma, Director of ISRO's Space Situational Awareness Centre.

### How AI Guardian Works

The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms that:

- **Detect threats**: Real-time analysis of debris trajectories with 99.2% accuracy
- **Predict collisions**: 48-hour advance warning capability
- **Optimize maneuvers**: Calculate fuel-efficient evasive actions automatically
- **Learn continuously**: Self-improving algorithms that adapt to new debris patterns

### Impact on India's Space Program

With over Rs. 1,000 crore worth of satellite assets in orbit, this system protects critical infrastructure including:

- Communication satellites
- Earth observation spacecraft
- Navigation systems
- Scientific research missions

ISRO's AI Guardian represents a major leap in India's indigenous space technology capabilities and positions the nation as a leader in space security solutions.
