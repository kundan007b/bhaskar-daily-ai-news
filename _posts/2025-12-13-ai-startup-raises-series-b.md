Bengaluru-headquartered **NovaCopilot** closed a $45 million Series B led by Vertex Growth with participation from Lightspeed and existing backers. The company builds generative AI copilots that plug into ERP, CRM, and internal developer platforms.

The startup says annual recurring revenue grew 3x in 2025, driven by manufacturing and fintech customers. Co-founder and CEO Rhea Menon told KB Tech News the fresh capital will expand the product’s retrieval-augmented generation stack and safety filters.

> “Indian enterprises want copilots that respect data boundaries and audit trails. We’re investing in guardrails, Hindi/English coverage, and private model hosting,” Menon said.

The company plans to double its engineering team in Bengaluru and open a Pune hub focused on latency optimizations. A regional go-to-market push in Southeast Asia is slated for early 2026.
